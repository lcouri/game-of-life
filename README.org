* Game of life
  A game of life implemention I came up with after reading [[http://disruptive-communications.com/conwaylifejavascript/][this blogpost]]

  There's a bunch of improvements I'd like to make, like adding more user controls to things like the size of the grid, the starting set of live cells, visuals, etc.

  This is a quick more efficient implementation I came up with, but I'll probably come back to this after doing some more research.
